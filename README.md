 **Pull image from Docker Registry:**
 
 $ docker image pull alpine

Alpine image is a lightweight image that can be used as a base image.

**List the images:**

$ docker image ls

REPOSITORY                 TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE

**Delete Images:**
$ sudo docker rmi 22f4e4d8dc23 

The above command end shows the image id, to delete the image with its id.

**Forcefully Delete Images:**

sudo docker rmi -f   d2c94e258dcb 

The image can be used as a base image to create any container, but we can delete it. 

**Port Mapping in Docker:**

There are many reasons we do port mapping, for example accessing running services inside the container with port number and IP address from the local host server to the docker container, security is also important.
