**Delete Images:**
$ sudo docker rmi 22f4e4d8dc23 

The above command end shows the image id, to delete the image with its id.

**Forcefully Delete Images:**

sudo docker rmi -f   d2c94e258dcb 

The image can be used as a base image to create any container, but we can delete it. 

**Port Mapping in Docker:**

There are many reasons we do port mapping, for example accessing running services inside the container with port number and IP address from the local host server to the docker container, security is also important.
